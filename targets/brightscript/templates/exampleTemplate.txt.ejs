Templates have a mix of "as is" portions, and generated portions.
They can access variables given to them by the make.js locals object.

You can do complex logic in tags as well.
Note, Spacing and such can be very tricky with the ejs tags.  Just try to get the destination to look correct.  Your ejs file is going to look pretty awful, and there's no avoiding it.
<% for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
%>ForLine: <%- i %>
<% } // end of for loop %>

The above example (in the template) has some logic tags, that wrap the for loop.  These are javascript instructions.
It also has a transform tag, which writes the value of "i" to each line.
<% // Comments inside of logic tags need to be commented as if they're javascript... because they are.  This is how you write comments that won't show up at all in the destination file %>

We version every sdk, and that version is built into the system.  You should publish that somewhere in your sdk, for tracking and debugging
sdkVersion = <%- sdkVersion %>
